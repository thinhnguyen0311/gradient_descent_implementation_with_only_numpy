# Linear Regression implementation with Gradient Descent using only Numpy.

We certainly don't do this at work. Because there are tons of libraries such as Scikit-Learn, Keras, Tensorflow which can process the Linear Regression model by just one click.

The aim of this mini-project is to execute the Gradient Descent step-by-step to understand deeply about what's going behind the scene, what's implemented inside those Machine Learning libraries above, and to get the intuition of the Gradient Descent Algorithm.
